# Fix for "Contact Form Temporarily Unavailable" Message

## Problem
The contact form was showing "Contact form temporarily unavailable" because EmailJS library wasn't loading properly before the form tried to use it.

## Solution Applied

### 1. index.html - Better EmailJS Loading
Added a retry mechanism that waits up to 5 seconds for the EmailJS library to load:
```javascript
function waitForEmailJS() {
    if (window.emailjs) {
        emailjs.init('ihlv_qkqYTcY_gCw7');
        console.log('✓ EmailJS initialized successfully');
        window.emailjsReady = true;
    } else if (emailjsRetries < maxRetries) {
        emailjsRetries++;
        setTimeout(waitForEmailJS, 100);
    }
}
```

### 2. script.js - Improved Form Handling
- Removed the error message that was being shown
- Added retry logic when user submits form
- If EmailJS isn't ready, form waits and retries automatically
- Better error messages if something goes wrong

## Result
✅ Contact form no longer shows "temporarily unavailable"  
✅ Form will wait for EmailJS to load  
✅ Form will work automatically once EmailJS is ready  
✅ Better error handling if service doesn't load  

## How It Works Now

1. When page loads, script waits for EmailJS library (up to 5 seconds)
2. Once EmailJS loads, it initializes with your credentials
3. Form is ready to use
4. If user submits before EmailJS is ready, form waits and retries
5. Email sends successfully once EmailJS is available

## Testing

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Reload the page
3. Check browser console (F12 → Console) for messages
4. You should see: "✓ EmailJS initialized successfully"
5. Contact form should work normally

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "temporarily unavailable"?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify internet connection (CDN needs access)
- Try a different browser
- Clear cache and reload

### "emailjs-test.html"
A test file was created to diagnose loading issues. Open it in a browser to see if EmailJS loads properly.
